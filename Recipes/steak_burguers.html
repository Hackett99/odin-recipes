    <h1>Mom's Potato Latkes</h1>
    <img src="/odin-recipes/Images/1423828-090a3d36c3fe4dda80c7adeaba5ea1a0.webp">
    <p>Latkes (potato pancakes) are a must-have at Hanukkah, but are really wonderful any time of the year! 
        This is my mother's recipe, which is honestly the best potato latke I've had. 
        I usually end up making a second batch because they disappear so quickly. 
        I've tried other recipes and always return to this one. 
        Lovely topped with sour cream or applesauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Montreal steak seasoning</li>
        <li>4 hamburger buns, split</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. </li>
        <li>Mix ground beef and steak seasoning together in a bowl. Form mixture into four patties. </li>
        <li>Grill patties on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center, 5 to 6 minutes per side. 
            An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). </li>
        <li> Serve on hamburger buns. </li>
    </ol>
