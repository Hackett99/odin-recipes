    <h1>Mom's Potato Latkes</h1>
    <img src="/odin-recipes/Images/1423828-090a3d36c3fe4dda80c7adeaba5ea1a0.webp">
    <p>Latkes (potato pancakes) are a must-have at Hanukkah, but are really wonderful any time of the year! 
        This is my mother's recipe, which is honestly the best potato latke I've had. 
        I usually end up making a second batch because they disappear so quickly. 
        I've tried other recipes and always return to this one. 
        Lovely topped with sour cream or applesauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon Goya Extra Virgin Olive Oil</li>
        <li>½ pound ground beef</li>
        <li>½ medium yellow onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>¼ cup Goya Tomato Sauce</li>
        <li>6 Goya Spanish Olives Stuffed with Minced Pimientos, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons Goya Sofrito</li>
        <li>1 packet Sazon Goya with Coriander and Annatto</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Goya Minced Garlic</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon Goya Dried Oregano</li>
        <li>Goya Ground Black Pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) package yellow or white Goya Discos empanada discs, thawed</li>
        <li>1 quart Goya Corn Oil, for frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add ground beef; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes. 
            Add onions and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomato sauce, olives, sofrito, sazón, garlic, oregano, and pepper. 
            Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until mixture thickens, about 15 minutes. 
        </li>
        <li>Roll empanada disks on a lightly floured surface until 1/2 inch larger in diameter. 
            Spoon about 1 tablespoon meat mixture into the middle of each disk. 
            Moisten the disk edges with water, fold in half over filling to form a half-moon, and pinch to seal (or seal with a fork). 
        </li>
        <li>Heat 2 1/2 inches corn oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
            Working in batches, fry empanadas until crisp and golden brown, flipping once, 4 to 6 minutes. Transfer to paper towels to drain. 
        </li>
    </ol>
