        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. </li>
        <li>Mix ground beef and steak seasoning together in a bowl. Form mixture into four patties. </li>
        <li>Grill patties on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center, 5 to 6 minutes per side.
